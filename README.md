# Machine Learning

This repository is used to store the Python code found in the book [What you need to know about Machine Learning](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AotpOipZ2Sr2hhnufbxFpn_ro8_m?e=UhDxd7), written by [me](https://ar.linkedin.com/in/gacanepa), reviewed by [Walter Molina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waltermolina/), and published by Packt Publishing.

### Author bio

Gabriel A. Cánepa is a software developer, [Linux Foundation certified system administrator](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/verify-linux-certifications) (LFCS-1500-0576-0100), and technical writer from Córdoba, Argentina. He currently works as a full-stack and DevOps Engineer at [Scalar](https://scalar.io). When he's not programming, typing commands or writing articles, he enjoys telling bedtime stories with his wife to his two daughters and playing with them, which is the greatest pleasure of his life.

### Updates

The code in section 4 was converted to Python 3 on July 6, 2023 after I presented a webinar for [Donweb](https://donweb.com/). The concepts in the book are still valid, but the code was updated to reflect the latest changes in the Python language.
